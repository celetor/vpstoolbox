[TG Channel](https://t.me/vpstoolbox) [简体中文](README.md)

Tired of always needing to manually enter commands to install blog, online drive, RSS, email, proxy? VPSToolBox provides a complete set of fully automated solutions, free your hands, starting today!

> After observation, **the problem of automatic certificate renewal has been solved**, the solution has been stable and can be used normally for a long time.

## One click command

```bash
apt-get update --fix-missing && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install sudo curl -y && curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnrosen1/vpstoolbox/master/vps.sh | sudo bash
````

> Only supports **Debian/Ubuntu** systems.

## Preconditions and key points (Usage instruction)

1. **Trojan-GFW does not support Cloudflare CDN! ! ! ** ( ![Do not open CDN](images/cf1.png) )
2. Please run as **root(sudo -i)** (**overwrite installation**).

![root](images/root.png)

4. Please [buy](https://www.namesilo.com/?rid=685fb47qi)/[white prostitution](https://www.freenom.com)/ use your existing **domain name** and **[Complete DNS A resolution](https://dnschecker.org/)**, point the domain name to your VPS IP, (Namesilo takes 15+min to take effect at the slowest). ![dns](images/dns.png)
5. Please **completely close or disable the VPS firewall (ie open all TCP + UDP ports) in the Server/VPS/Various Control Panel. ![Firewall](images/firewall.png)**
> _Trojan-gfw and Shadowsocks-rust both support **Fullcone-nat** but need to open all ports on the server to use it. _
6. [HTTP application](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/Blogs-and-tutorials) TLS certificate requires **domain name A resolution to take effect**, [API application](https: //github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi) you need to enter the correct information. ![issuecert](images/cert.png)
7. After installation, **BBR is enabled by default**, no manual configuration is required.
8. If you use gRPC to forward through Cloudflare, you need to allow gRPC in Cloudflare Control Panel -> Network. ![grpc](images/grpc.png) ![ssl](images/ssl.png)

## Bug feedback and Feature request

- [x][Github Issue](https://github.com/johnrosen1/vpstoolbox/issues)
- [x] [TG Group](https://t.me/vpstoolbox_chat)

Note:

1. I have a high probability of not seeing other feedback methods.
2. Unless you have a reason to convince me or directly submit a PR, ** will not accept proxy software support requests** (such as wireguard and the like).
3. No matter what happens, please **be sure to attach the steps to reproduce the error, screenshots, OS release and other information**, otherwise I will not be able to provide any help.

## Code Quality

1. This project realizes **modularity**
2. This project, which I personally wrote from the beginning of learning bash, may have many unreasonable points, and it is not recommended to study it as a direct teaching material.

## Rclone and how to use the fully automatic upload script

**[Aria2+Rclone+Onedrive realizes fully automated download](https://johnrosen1.com/2021/02/14/onedrive/)**

## Mail Service Terms of Use

1. A non-mainland China VPS/server with **independent public network IPv4** and **25/143/443/465/587/993 and other TCP ports must be able to use normally**.
   > _Alibaba cloud, Google cloud platform, vultr and other manufacturers do not meet this requirement (of course, if you are willing to negotiate with them, it is none of my business.). _
2. The server/VPS must have greater than or equal to **2+GB RAM and 30+GB Storage**.
3. A paid domain name (recommended [Namesilo](https://www.namesilo.com/?rid=685fb47qi)), .com/.xyz/.moe and other suffixes do not matter.
4. Your server (VPS) must support **rDNS(PTR) record** (unless you want your mail to be listed as spam).
5. The ip of your server (VPS) must not be in various mail blacklists (otherwise all mails you send will be listed as spam).
6. This project does not support Postfixadmin, LDAP and other related functions.
7. The automatic junk removal function defaults to 30d to clean up junk mail, and 14d to delete it.

> Due to the particularity of the mailbox service, it is only recommended for those who need it (and are willing to toss).

## Debug related

1. This project mainly uses systemd+docker-compose to start the service.
2. If you are too lazy to write the specifics, check the running status with `systemctl`, and remember to give feedback if you have any problems.
